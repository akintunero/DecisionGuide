## 🎯 What is DecisionGuide?

DecisionGuide helps governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) professionals make **consistent, defensible decisions** through structured assessment logic.

**The Problem:**  
Risk and compliance teams often make inconsistent decisions because there's no standardized framework. Same vendor, different auditors, different outcomes.

**The Solution:**  
Research-backed assessment logic (ISO 27001, GDPR, NIST CSF) that guides—not automates—professional judgment.

### Why DecisionGuide?

✅ **Transparent logic** - See exactly how decisions are reached  
✅ **Zero-document approach** - No file uploads, no privacy risks  
✅ **Audit-ready exports** - PDF, JSON, and TXT formats with full decision trail  
✅ **Open source & extensible** - Add your own assessment frameworks  
✅ **Free forever** - No subscriptions, no paywalls

## 🚀 Features

### Current Assessment Frameworks

- **DPIA Requirement Check** - Determine if Data Protection Impact Assessment is required (with jurisdiction-specific guidance for UK, EU, US, Nigeria)
- **Incident Reporting** - Decide whether security incidents require external reporting
- **Vendor Risk Tiering** - Classify vendors as Low, Medium, or High risk

### Core Capabilities

- 🎯 **Interactive decision trees** - Questions appear one at a time based on your answers
- 📊 **Full audit trail** - Complete path from questions to final decision
- 📄 **Professional exports** - Download results as PDF, JSON, or TXT
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** - All processing happens locally, no data collection
- 🌐 **Jurisdiction support** - Tailored guidance for different regulatory frameworks

## 📖 How It Works

### Decision Tree Structure

Each assessment is defined by a simple JSON file in the `logic/` folder:

```json
{
  "id": "vendor_risk",
  "title": "Vendor Risk Assessment",
  "description": "Assess vendor risk level",
  "root": "q1",
  "nodes": {
    "q1": {
      "type": "choice",
      "text": "Does vendor process sensitive data?",
      "options": {
        "Yes": {"next": "q2"},
        "No": {
          "decision": "LOW_RISK",
          "explanation": "No sensitive data processing."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**That’s it!** No Python coding required to add new assessments.
