# DecisionGuide

A lightweight, logic-based assistant that helps analysts, auditors, and governance teams make clear, consistent decisions using structured decision flows.

DecisionGuide removes confusion during assessments by guiding users through predefined yes/no logic rather than relying on subjective judgement.  
Built with Python + Streamlit, it is fully open-source, easy to extend, and safe to run locally.
