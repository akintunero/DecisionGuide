      "options": {
        "No data and no system access (e.g. stationery, catering, cleaning, uniforms)": {
          "decision": "TIER_3_LOW",
          "explanation": "Tier: 🟢 Tier 3 – Low Risk\n\nThe vendor does not access systems and does not process your data.\n\nWhat to request:\n- Basic contract\n- Pricing details\n- Delivery or service terms\n\nNot required:\n- No DPA\n- No SLA\n- No security questionnaires\n- No SOC 2/ISO evidence\n\nExamples:\n- Stationery supplier\n- Catering services\n- Cleaning company\n- Uniform suppliers\n- Furniture providers\n\nWhy this matters:\nBecause the vendor has no access to systems or data, they pose almost no security or privacy risk. Keeping requirements light avoids unnecessary paperwork and speeds up procurement."
        },
        "Low/internal data only (e.g. training tools, survey apps, booking tools)": {
          "decision": "TIER_2_MEDIUM",
          "explanation": "Tier: 🟡 Tier 2 – Medium Risk\n\nThe vendor handles low-sensitivity or internal-only data.\n\nWhat to request:\n- Light SLA (response times)\n- High-level security policy\n- Data storage region\n- Data retention period\n- DPA only if personal data is involved\n\nNot required:\n- No SOC 2/ISO mandatory\n- No heavy questionnaires\n- No DR/BCM evidence\n\nExamples:\n- Staff learning platforms\n- Internal survey tools\n- Department-only scheduling tools\n- Basic SaaS utilities used internally\n\nWhy this matters:\nThese services touch internal or operational data but do not carry high privacy or security risk. The focus is ensuring they handle data responsibly without overwhelming the vendor with enterprise-level requirements."
        },
        "Personal data or integration (e.g. HR, CRM, payroll, SaaS logins, API services)": {
          "decision": "TIER_1_HIGH",
          "explanation": "Tier: 🟠 Tier 1 – High Risk\n\nThe vendor processes personal data and/or integrates with your systems.\n\nWhat to request:\n- DPA\n- Sub-processor list\n- SLA (uptime + support)\n- ISO 27001, SOC 2, or pen test\n- MFA and access control summary\n- Data flow diagram\n- 48-hour incident notification\n- Exit and deletion plan\n\nExamples:\n- HR systems\n- CRM platforms\n- Payroll/timekeeping tools\n- SaaS with user accounts\n- API providers sending or receiving your data\n\nWhy this matters:\nPersonal data and system integrations increase both privacy risk and cyber exposure. These requirements ensure the vendor follows strong security practices and that you can track how data flows through their service."
        },
        "Critical/high-impact service (e.g. cloud hosting, identity providers, core platforms)": {
          "decision": "TIER_0_CRITICAL",
          "explanation": "Tier: 🔴 Tier 0 – Critical\n\nThe vendor supports critical services or has privileged access.\n\nWhat to request:\n- DPA (if personal data)\n- Strong contract with security clauses\n- SOC 2 Type II and/or ISO 27001\n- Pen test summary\n- Security architecture overview\n- MFA and privileged access controls\n- SLA with uptime guarantee\n- BCM/DR documentation + test evidence\n- 24-hour incident notification\n- Detailed exit plan and data deletion confirmation\n\nExamples:\n- AWS, Azure, GCP\n- Enterprise-wide identity provider (Okta, Entra)\n- Core clinical or business systems\n- Payment processors\n- Managed service providers with admin access\n\nWhy this matters:\nCritical vendors create direct operational dependency. A failure, breach, or outage would significantly disrupt your organisation. These requirements ensure you have deep assurance, resilience, and strong contractual protections."
